## Solution Deliverables
I developed the dashboard using Power BI (Version: 2.112.603.0 64-bit, December 2022).

Deliverables include -

1. Final report that includes intuitive and compelling visuals to tell the story.
2. Data model: Star schema (with 6 many-to-one relationships).
3. All Power Query tables: 1 fact table and 6 dimension tables.

## Ordered workflow in getting to the solution

1. Data import from csv file.
2. Data transformed in Power Query and loaded to data model.
3. Six many-to-one relationships created to form a start schema.
4. Visuals created in report view, enriched with relevant DAX measures.
